# io_scene_a3d
Blender plugin to load A3D 3.2 and 3.3 models (3.1 not supported), 3.2 is most complete 3.3 is not so complete; this code will eventually be merged into the alternativa3d_tools github repo.

The code can read all the A3D3 data but not all of it is imported yet, some material data + transforms + some vertex data and the codebase could use a cleanup.
